**story**
Once upon a time there was a miller, who was a boastful man. One day the miller’s daughter was spinning cloth in a doorway, when the king rode past. He stopped and
spoke to the girl, and the miller began to boast. “She can even spin straw into gold, Your Majesty!” he said.
Needless to say, the poor girl could do nothing of the sort, but the king was greedy. He took the miller’s daughter to his palace.There, he shut her in a room with a spinning
wheel and a huge pile of straw saying, “Spin this straw into gold by morning or it’ll be the worse for you!”
